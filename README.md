# Language-Translator-Using-Python
This repository contains a Python application that can be used to translate text and voice between multiple languages. The application uses the translate module for text translation and the playaudio, ggts, and other modules for voice translation.

To use the application, simply enter the text or voice you want to translate into the input field and select the desired language from the drop-down list. The application will then translate the text or voice into the selected language and display the translation in the output field.

The application is easy to use and can be used by anyone, regardless of their level of programming experience. The application is also open source, so you can modify it to fit your specific needs.

Here are some of the features of the language translator:

->Supports a wide range of languages
->Easy to use
->Open source
